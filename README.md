# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.Goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
